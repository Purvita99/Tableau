## Global Superstore 
Global Superstore is a global online retailer based in New York, boasting a broad product catalogue and aiming to be a one-stop-shop for its customers. Global Superstoreâ€™s clientele, hailing from 147 different countries, can browse through an endless offering with more than 10,000 products. This large selection comprises three main categories: office supplies (e.g., staples), furniture (e.g., chairs), and technology (e.g., smartphones). The access to the dataset provided us with information on the 51,291 orders that were processed between 2011and 2014. The dataset provided 24 attributes including Ship Date, City, Category, and Order Priority. 
  
We aim to mine the data to evaluate the performance of the Superstore situated in different cities all over the world under different markets, during 2011-2014. Through our research, we hope to provide insights about the top preforming and underperforming products/categories/markets, the problems in selling and market opportunities, sales forecasting and sales activities that generate revenue.
